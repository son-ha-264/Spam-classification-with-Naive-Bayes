# Spam Classification with Naive Bayes model

The [UCI Spam Colletion Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) is a dataset of labelled SMS colleted for mobile phone spam research. The SMS texts mostly come from UK and Singapore, and are collected from various free sources on the Internet. 
In this notebook I will build a simple Naive Bayes model to classify which SMS is spam and which is not. This is the classic 'Ham or Spam' task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
